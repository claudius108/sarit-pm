                    <p>Some brief hints are given here — for fuller explanations, please consult the
                        other search instructions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are you searching for all occurrences of a certain string? <ul>
                                <li>Search using the NGram Index.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Do you want to use Regular Expressions? <ul>
                                <li>With both NGram Index and Lucene Full-Text Index, use standard
                                    regex syntax for ".", "?", "+" , "*", "[]" and "{}". </li>
                                <li>Enclose Regular Expressions in forward slashes ("/") when using
                                    the Lucene Full-Text Index. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Do you want to search for the co-occurrence of a number of words? <ul>
                                <li>Check whether the texts are divided into words, and if they are,
                                    select Use Lucene Full-Text Index and enter "AND" between the
                                    different words. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>If you input a IAST search term or Devanagari search term, your search
                            term will by default be automatically converted to both IAST and in
                            Devanagari. If you wish to search using IAST or Devanagari only, see
                            below.</li>

                    <p>If you hover over the dropdowns in the Search panel, you will see their

                        <li>Search For What? <ul>
                                <li>You can either enter the precise term to search for or use
                                    Regular Expressions.</li>

                                <li>If you enter a search term in IAST and choose "Search with
                                    Devanagari and IAST", your search term will be converted to
                                    Devanagari and your search will include both your original
                                    (IAST) search term and the search term converted into
                                    Devanagari.</li>
                                <li>If you enter a search term in IAST and choose "Search with
                                    Devanagari", your search term will be converted to Devanagari
                                    and your search will not be performed with the original (IAST)
                                    search term, only with the search term converted into
                                    Devanagari.</li>
                                <li>If you enter a search term in IAST and choose "Search with
                                    IAST", the search term will not be converted and your search
                                    will only be performed with your original (IAST) search
                                    term.</li>
                                <li>This applies the other way 'round as well, so:</li>
                                <li>If you enter a search term in Devanagari and choose "Search with
                                    Devanagari and IAST", your search term will be converted to IAST
                                    and your search will include both your original (Devanagari)
                                    search term and the search term converted into IAST.</li>
                                <li>If you enter a search term in Devanagari and choose "Search with
                                    IAST", your search term will be converted to IAST and your

                                    Devanagari", the search term will not be converted and your
                                    search will only be performed with your original (Devanagari)
                                    search term.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Use Which Index? <ul>
                                <li>Select Use NGram Index if the texts you are searching are not
                                    segmented into words or if you want to be sure that you find
                                    each and every occurence of a string. In general, use this index
                                    with all texts in Devanagari.</li>
                                <li>Select Use Lucene Full-Text Index only if the texts you are
                                    searching are segmented into words. This applies to a few texts
                                    in romanisation, mainly the Arthaśāstra. For information about
                                    the remaining texts, see <a

                                <li>Selecting Use Lucene Full-Text Index gives you extra search
                                    options, see <a href="search-help-lucene.html">Lucene Search
                                        Help</a>. </li>

                        <li>Search Which Document Part? <ul>
                                <li>You can choose to search the TEI Header or the TEI Text or
                                    both.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Search In Texts By Which Authors? <ul>
                                <li>You can choose Search In Texts By Any Author to search
                                    throughout the corpus or you can select one or more authors to
                                    search in the texts attributed to them.</li>
                                <li>Note that you can also select individual texts to search by
                                    clicking on the check-boxes to the left of the titles.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Search Narrowly Or Broadly? <ul>
                                <li>This option is mainly relevant you are interested in finding the
                                    co-occurrence of more than one search term within a certain part
                                    of the text.</li>
                                <li>A narrow search searches for hits in smaller parts, whereas a
                                    broad search searches for hits in larger parts. Two terms may
                                    occur together in a larger part, but not in a smaller part.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Perform New Search or Continue Last Search? <ul>
                                <li>This gives you the option to refine your previous search, by
                                    restricting or broadening the search result.</li>
                                <li>If you choose Perform New Search, your will search afresh, so
                                    your search will not relate to any previous searches.</li>
                                <li>If you choose "AND Last Search", your search will restrict your
                                    last search by requiring that the search criteria for both the
                                    last and the present search are satisfied. You typically use
                                    this to search for the co-occurence of two words. </li>
                                <li>If you choose "OR Last Search", your search will broaden your
                                    last search by including both the results from the last and the
                                    present search in the search results. You typically use this to
                                    search for alternative forms of a word. </li>
                                <li>If you choose "NOT Last Search", your search will restrict your
                                    last search by excluding the results from the present search.
                                    You typically use this to remove specific hits from the search
                                    results. </li>
                                <li>Note that if you search using the Lucene Full-Text Index, you
                                    can perform these operations in one search. If you search using
                                    the Ngram Index, using this dropdown is the only way to use
                                    Boolean operators. </li>
                                <li>Note that all search hits are highlighted in page view when you
                                    search using the Lucene Full-Text Index, but only one will be
                                    highlighted when you search using the NGram Index.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
