                    <p>The interface of the SARIT application consists of four main pages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a start page for listing the works contained in SARIT and performing
                            searches in them
                        </li>
                        <li>a page for displaying the SARIT project's description of the editorial
                            processes behind a SARIT text edition and for listing the text's table of
                            contents, reached after clicking the title of the text in the list of
                            works
                        </li>
                        <li>a page for displaying the list of hits resulting from a search</li>
                        <li>a page for viewing part of a text selected by clicking on a reference in the
                            table of contents or on a hit in the hitlist.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each of these pages will be described in the following.</p>

                    <h2>List of Works and Search Interface</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>The start page of the SARIT web platform displays a list of the texts in
                            the SARIT corpus and the search interface. </p>
                        <img width="100%" src="resources/img/search-interface.png"/>
                        <p>The list of texts gives the text's title, notes its putative author(s) or
                            commentator(s) and whether the text uses Devanagari script or
                            romanisation. Most texts exist in both Devanagari script or
                            romanisation, one converted from the other.</p>
                        <p>There are also links for downloading the texts in various formats: epub,
                            pdf and xml (zipped).</p>
                        <p> The last link gives the possibility of opening the XML containing the
                            text in an application called eXide. eXide is an application in the <a
                                    href="http:exist-db.org/">eXist-db database</a> that has been used
                            to develop the SARIT application. eXide also allows you to perform
                            searches, using XPath and XQuery, the main programming languages used in
                            the SARIT application, but that is another (rather long) story ….</p>
                        <p>The search interface, located on the right of the list of works, offers a
                            number of options, among these to search based on the information
                            displayed in the list.</p>
                        <p>These options will be described in the following. The names of the
                            dropdown menus are displayed when hovering over them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Search For What?</h3>
                        <p>The search term is of course where you will be actively searching for
                            occurrences of the words and phrases you are interested in. All the
                            other choices you make in the search interface restrict or modify the
                            search term(s) you input here. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Search With Which Scripts?</h3>
                        <p>Your search term is automatically converted to make your search proceed
                            in both IAST romanisation and in Devanagari. If you wish to limit this,
                            select which script to search with.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Search Which Document Part?</h3>
                        <p>Each SARIT text consists of </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a header which provides information about the text edition and</li>
                            <li>the text proper.</li>
                        </ul>
			<p>In this dropdown menu you can select to search in one or both of
                        these document parts.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Search In Texts By Which Authors?</h3>
                        <p>You can choose <em>which texts</em> to target in your search in two
                            different ways.</p>
                        <p>If you wish to make selections among the texts based on their author, you
                            can use this dropdown menu. Note that you can select several
                            authors.</p>
                        <p>In order to select individual texts to search in, you can click the
                            checkboxes to the left of their titles in the list of works.</p>
                        <p>Note that if you do not make any choice, you will search in all available
                            texts – there is no need to click all checkboxes in order to perform a
                            search throughout all texts.</p>

                    <h2>The TEI Header and Table of Contents</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Clicking a title in the list of works will display the TEI header of the
                            text and its table of contents.</p>
                        <img width="75%" src="resources/img/header.png"/>
                        <p>The TEI header describes the text and the editorial processes that have
                            resulted in the SARIT edition. Since the header can be quite long, by
                            default only the first part, which gives the title and author(s) and
                            lists the persons and institutions that have contributed to the SARIT
                            version is shown. If you wish to access the whole TEI header, click the
                            Toggle Full Header button.</p>
                        <p>At the bottom of this page is shown the table of contents of the SARIT
                            text. This may divide into three parts, front matter, the text itself,
                            and back matter.</p>
                        <p>The table of contents can be expanded by clicking on the plus signs and
                            collapsed again by clicking on minus signs. The table of contents
                            descends three levels, i.e. divisions below the third level are not
                            shown (for reasons of speed).</p>
                        <p>Clicking on one of the links in the table of contents will take you to
                            the page view for the part of the text in question.</p>

                    <h2>The Hitlist</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>After performing a search for e.g. "lakṣaṇa", you will be presented with
                            a hitlist.</p>
                        <img src="resources/img/hitlist.png"/>
                        <p>The results of your search are presented in the form of a
                            keywords-in-context (KWIC) display, centring the strings that were found
                            matching to your search term, with the context the matches occur in on
                            the left and right. Clicking the center string (here, "lakṣaṇa") will
                            display the text in which the hit occurs, with all matches
                            highlighted.</p>
                        <p>The order in which the hits occur differs according to the index used for
                            search. With an NGram Index, the hits are simply ordered according to
                            the title of the texts in which they occur. With a Lucene Full-Text
                            Index, the hits are ordered according to their score. The score is a
                            measure of the relevancy of the hits in relation to the search. What
                            this means is a little technical, but, generally speaking, the more
                            often more of your search terms occur in a hit and the rarer the search
                            terms are within the texts searched, the higher the score will be.</p>
                        <p>The search term matches are grouped in hits, i.e. according to the levels
                            of the document targeted by your search, with clickable references to
                            the text as a whole (showing the header information and table of
                            contents) and the part of the text in which the hit occurred (displaying
                            the text itself). One hit (such as the second here) may contain several
                            matches.</p>
                        <p>The hits are shown twenty at a time on each page. At the top, you have
                            the total number of hits and a means of navigating from hit group to hit
                            group.</p>

                    <h2>The Page View</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>After clicking on one of the links that leads to a direct display of a
                            page, you are shown the page view.</p>
                        <img src="resources/img/page-view.png"/>
                        <p>If you have clicked on a search term link in the hitlist, the search term(s)
                            will all be highlighted if you are searching through the Luucene Full-Text index, but only
                            one will be highlighted if you search through the NGram Index.</p>
                        <p>It is not possible to view a whole text, due to the heavy load on the
                            browser this would entail in case of very long texts, but as a substitute for this you can
                            download the whole text in a number of formats from the list of
                            works.</p>
                        <p>You have the option of moving back and forth in the text. There may occur
                            a "blank layer", with no text displayed, in which case you should just
                            move on one click. Such "blank layers" occur because the text moves from
                            one division down to a lower division which does not have any text and does not have a
                            header.</p>
                        <p>From the button in the left side of the screen, you have the option of
                            accessing the table of contents, allowing you to move from chapter to
                            chapter or section to section.</p>
                        <p>Clicking the title of the text will take you to the page displaying the
                            text's header and table of contents.</p>
