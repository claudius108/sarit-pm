                <p>In the SARIT app, a number of search options are available, making it also possible to perform quite
                    advanced searches.
                    Lucene Full-Text search is based on the open source search engine <a href="http://lucene.apache.org"
                                                                                         target="_blank">Apache
                        Lucene</a> and brings into play all the
                    options that Lucene provides. </p>
                <section>
                    <h2>Search Strategies</h2>
                    <p>There are searches – and searches.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One can search by simply filling in words in the query field and press return (or
                            click the magnifying glass).
                        </li>
                        <li>One can use the standard Lucene search options. These consists of marking which
                            words you would like to occur as hits and which word must (or must not) occur, of
                            stringing together words with AND, OR and NOT, grouping words with parentheses, and
                            so on. Quite complicated searches can be made with these options.
                        </li>
                        <li>One can use Lucene wildcards - <code>?</code> for any single character and <code>*</code>
                            for any sequence
                            of zero, one or more characters.
                        </li>
                        <li>Even more advanced, one can use regular expressions, the most precise (and
                            complicated) way of searching for texts strings.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All of these search options can be used in combination, so one can freely e.g. mix plain,
                        wildcard and regular expression searches.</p>
                    <p>These three different search strategies will be presented below, after a brief
                        description of the way hits are displayed.</p>

                    <h2>Hitlist and Search Relevance</h2>
                    <p>When searching for books in a library catalogue, one can usually choose to have the hits
                        displayed according to relevance or according to author, title or suchlike. In the
                        SARIT app, hits from Lucene searches are only displayed according to relevance, according to a
                        "score"
                        computed for each search. The score is a quite complicated thing in itself, but
                        basically, the more times your search terms occur in your search scope and the less
                        common they are in the index (that is, in SARIT works) the higher the score they
                        will get and the more prominent they will be in the hitlist. </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Standard Lucene Syntax</h2>
                    <p>In the following, examples are drawn from imaginary searches in Shakespeare's works. It is
                        intended that somone knowledgable in Sanskrit convert the examples to something more relavant to
                        SARIT.</p>
                    <p>If you simply fill in some words in the query field, and do not use any of the special
                        Lucene search operators, you are saying that you would like to see as many of the words
                        in the search scope as possible.</p>
                    <p>With Lucene standard syntax, there are two ways you can impose restrictions of the
                        co-occurrence of search terms: you can either prefix words with + and - or you use the
                        boolean terms AND, OR and NOT (written in upper-case). In both cases, you can
                        additionally group your search expressions using parentheses.</p>
                    <p>The option of using + and - is better suited to a search which orders hits according to
                        score. Here you let words stand as they are (without + or -) if you would like all of
                        them to occur in hits, but if there is only one of them present, you also want to have
                        it displayed as a hit If you prefix one or more words with +, they must occur in a hit,
                        and if you prefix them with -, they must not occur as a hit. If you search for <code>snake
                            fillet</code> you get a lot of hits with either <code>snake</code> or <code>killed</code>
                        and perhaps some with
                        both. If you search for "snake +fillet, all your hits will contain <code>fillet</code>, but they
                        may or may not contain <code>snake</code>. If you search for <code>snake -fillet</code>, you
                        would get hits
                        with <code>snake</code>, but only if they do not contain <code>fillet</code>.</p>
                    <p>If you use AND, OR and NOT, the logic is rather different. If you search for <code>snake AND
                        fillet</code> you get hits with both <code>snake</code> and <code>fillet</code> and none with
                        only one of them. This
                        corresponds to <code>+snake +killed</code>. If you search for <code>snake OR killed</code>, this
                        is the same
                        as simply searching for <code>snake fillet</code>. If you search for <code>snake NOT
                            fillet</code>, this
                        equals searching for <code>snake -fillet</code>.</p>
                    <p>Searches can acquire higher complexity use of parentheses. Here the use of AND, OR and
                        NOT may come more naturally. Say you want to find passages where the word <code>fillet</code>
                        occurs but where also at least one of the words <code>snake</code>, <code>deer</code>, <code>bird</code>
                        occurs. You can
                        express this by <code>(snake OR deer OR bird) AND fillet</code>. An AND enforces "must occur" on
                        both sides, so both one of the animals and the word <code>fillet</code> have to occur in the
                        hits.
                        Say (for some reason) you do not wish the words <code>pricket</code> and <code>mouse</code> to
                        occur in your
                        hits – you then embroider your search expression with <code>NOT (pricket OR mouse)</code> as
                        <code>(snake OR deer OR bird) AND fillet NOT (pricket OR mouse)</code></p>
                    <p>If you simply search for <code>pricket OR deer AND killed</code>, you will (because the AND rubs
                        off
                        to the left), search for passages where <code>deer</code> and <code>fillet</code> must occur,
                        but you would
                        also like <code>pricket</code> to be marked as a hit. You can enforce a certain logic on your
                        query
                        by grouping with parentheses.</p>
                    <p>If you search for <code>(snake OR deer) AND fillet</code> you are saying that one or both of
                        <code>snake</code>
                        and <code>deer</code> must occur, as must <code>fillet</code>.</p>
                    <p>If you search for <code>snake OR (deer AND fillet)</code>, you would like to retrieve hits where
                        <code>snake</code> occurs and you would like to retrieve hits where <code>deer</code> and <code>fillet</code>
                        go
                        together. In practice this means that you will get a lot of <code>snake</code>-only hits.</p>
                    <p>You can also nest parentheses, e.g. <code>(snake OR (deer AND fillet)) NOT pricket</code> will
                        remove the hits with <code>pricket</code> from <code>snake OR (deer AND fillet</code>. </p>
                    <p>As you can see, the options are many …. And as if this was not enough, there is also
                        regex – and regex syntax combined with standard syntax!</p>

                    <h2>Phrase Search</h2>
                    <p>A phrase search searches for a series of words in sequence. You activate phrase search by
                        enclosing the words in quotations marks. If you want to search for all occurences of "fenny
                        snake", you should input the search expression <code>"fenny snake"</code>. This is the way
                        searches are performed in word processing documents, except that here punctuation is
                        disregarded. To find "Fire burn, and cauldron bubble", you do not have to input the comma
                        (but it does not harm - it is removed automatically from your search expression).</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Proximity Search</h2>
                    <p>A proximity search allows you to search for all of the words in the hits within the
                        search scope, in the order they occur in, but within a certain proximity. You put the
                        search engine in proximity search mode by enclosing the words in quotation marks and
                        adding a tilde <code>~</code> after the rightmost quotation mark, immediately followed
                        by the number of words you wish to allow between the two words. If you search for
                        <code>"Fire bubble"~3</code> you will thus find "Fire burn, and cauldron bubble",
                        but if you only allow two words to intervene, <code>"Fire bubble"~2</code>, you will
                        not. More than two words are allowed: you can retrieve "I pray thee, stay with us: go
                        not to Wittenberg" with <code>"pray stay Wittenberg"~6</code>.</p>
                    <p>If you wish to search for words within a certain proximity, but regardless of the order
                        they occur in, you have to use an OR expression: <code>"slumber beware"~5 OR "beware
                            slumber"~5</code>. </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Fuzzy Search</h2>
                    <p>"Fuzzy Search" needs a little explanation. If you take a word, like "snake", you can make
                        changes and additions to it. One change would thus give you "spake", "slave", "snare"
                        and "snakes". If you make one more edits based on this, you can easily see that a lot of
                        words can be generated. Since this search is very time-consuming, the maximum number of
                        "edits" you can make is 2. To activate fuzzy search, you add a tilde <code>~</code>
                        after the word in question, <code>snake~2</code>.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Wildcard Expressions</h2>
                    <p>Wildcard Expressions allow you to mask individual characters or sequences of characters
                        inside words. Say, to switch examples, you wish to find all occurrences of "test" and of
                        "text". Now, you could search for <code>text test</code> (or <code>text OR test</code>), and
                        this would give
                        you what you wanted, but you can also use the wildcard <code>?</code> and search for
                        <code>te?t</code>
                        instead. This will find all words that consists of the two character "te", plus one
                        character which can be anything, and end up with the character "t". It would also find
                        "teat".</p>
                    <p>In addition to <code>?</code> which requires one and one only character, you can also use
                        <code>*</code> which
                        stands for any character zero, one or more times. If you search for <code>te*t</code>, you are
                        therefore likely to find many more words, among them "test" and "text", but also
                        "tempest", "testament" and "tent"</p>
                    <p>You do not have to signal in any way that you are performing a wildcard search: just
                        including <code>?</code> or <code>*</code> is enough.</p>
                    <p>A wildcard character cannot occur first in a search expression, so you cannot find
                        "Hamlet" with <code>?amlet</code> or <code>*let</code>. If you wish to perform searches of this
                        kind, you
                        should use a regular expression.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
                    <p>Regular Expressions are also known as "regex" or "regexp". They are a very powerful tool
                        for searching text (and for replacing text, but this is not relevant here). Lucene only
                        supports a restricted range of regex operators, but they should be sufficient for most
                        uses.</p>
                    <p>You put the search engine into regex mode by enclosing your search term with slashes. So
                        you would search e.g. for <code>/.{3}let/</code> to find "Hamlet" (but also, e.g. "fillet").</p>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Match any character</h3>
                        <p>The period <code>.</code> can be used to represent any character (this is the same
                            as the <code>?</code> wildcard).</p>
                        <p> In order to retrieve the string "snake", the following expressions can
                            be used:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <p>The question mark <code>?</code> makes the preceding shortest pattern optional.
                                It matches zero or one times. Note that in Lucene wildcard searches,
                                <code>?</code> stands for a character in itself; in regex searches the
                                question mark quantifies the immediately preceding character (or pattern). </p>

                            <p>Character classes are very important, since they allow you to mask variation with
                                more control than that offered by wildcards. You can thus use them to find words
                                even though they are written differently, e.g. have either "e" or "o" in a
                                certain position or have "a" and "e" in a certain position </p>
                            <p>Ranges of potential characters may be represented as character classes by
                                enclosing them in square brackets <code>[]</code>. A leading caret <code>^</code>
                                negates the character class, that is, all characters other than the ones
                                following are signified.</p>
